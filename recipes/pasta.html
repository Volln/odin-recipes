    <p>
      It's a very simple recipe that I often do for dinners and doesn't require
      many ingriedients
    </p>
    <h3>Ingriedients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Pasta, preferably spaghetti</li>
      <li>An onion, white kind for softer bites and red for crunchier</li>
      <li>Pancetta / Bacon that's already diced</li>
      <li>Parmeggiano</li>
      <li>Tomato sauce</li>
      <li>Some olive oil</li>
      <li>Chili power if you want to add some spice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>First you have to fill a pot with water and put it to boil</li>
      <li>
        Then you have to put a pan with a bit of olive oil on medium to high
        heat
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the pan is heated, put pancetta inside and stir once in a while and
        wait for it to get crispy
      </li>
      <li>
        Chop and dice an onion and put it in the pan once the pancetta get
        crispy
      </li>
      <li>
        As soon as the onion gets transparent, turn down the heat to low and
        pour the tomato sauce inside and let it reduce and thicken
      </li>
      <li>
        When the timer goes off for the pasta, take it from the stove and put it
        through a sieve to remove the excess water
      </li>
      <li>
        When the pasta is out and the sauce is thickened, combine the two in a
        bowl plate and add parmeggiano
      </li>
      <p>Tada! There's your quick and simple pasta recipe</p>
    </ol>
